;Quiz task: Code so that x = (a x b) + (c x d)

;Note #1: "a" will arbitrarily be assigned 2
;Note #2: "b" will arbitrarily be assigned 3
;Note #3: "c" will arbitrarily be assigned 4
;Note #4: "d" will arbitrarily be assigned 5
;Note #5: result "x" should turn out to be 26
;Note #6: correct result confirmed with gdb! Use "watch (int) x" instead of "watch (int) result"
